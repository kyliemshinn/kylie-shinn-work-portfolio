# kylie-shinn-work-portfolio

## Description

This projects purpose is to display all relevant work projects for future employers. The design is meant to be displayed in long columns taking up the entire page.

All links- within the header, Work images, and contact links should navigate to their respected locations.

The webpage has a clear, concise description with a recent picture floating side by side.

Below, there is recent work history displayed in images, that when you click on the image title, it will direct you to the Github page of the projects. The image displayed first should be displayed larger than the rest. The link will direct to my Github account to show all repositories done thus far.

The last section is links to LinkedIn, Github, and direct contact via email.

When the screen size decreases, the content will fall in columns so everything is still properly displayed on the screen. The layout should look the same and the font sizes should re-size as the screen flucuates.
